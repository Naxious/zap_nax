## Features

This is my first attempt at an extension.
I hope it will be useful to anyone working with the Roblox networking library called "ZAP".

At the moment, it supports syntax highlighting for .zap files so when your making your config.zap it is easier to see.

It also supports some intellisense, albeit not perfect it prevents alot of back and forth to reading the API for ZAP.

> Tip: Type "e" or "f" to see available args for event or funct as described on the ZAP API (<https://zap.redblox.dev/>).

## Requirements

Dependencies:

* `node`:  "^20.11.0"
* `vscode`: "^1.85.0"
* `typescript`: "^5.3.3"

## Extension Settings

None for now.

## Known Issues

Aside from eventually wanting to cleanup the intellisense not to sure atm.

## Release Notes

I hope anyone brave enough to venture into the awesome networking ZAP provides can find this extension useful!

### 1.0.0

Initial release of ZAP_NAX with syntax highlighting and basic intellisense functionality.
